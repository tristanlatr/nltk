distance from other related words in the output sentence.

IBM Model 4 improves the distortion model of Model 3, motivated by the
observation that certain words tend to be re-ordered in a predictable
way relative to one another. For example, &lt;adjective&gt;&lt;noun&gt; in English
usually has its order flipped as &lt;noun&gt;&lt;adjective&gt; in French.

Model 4 requires words in the source and target vocabularies to be
categorized into classes. This can be linguistically driven, like parts
of speech (adjective, nouns, prepositions, etc). Word classes can also
be obtained by statistical methods. The original IBM Model 4 uses an
information theoretic approach to group words into 50 classes for each
vocabulary.

Terminology:
Cept:
    A source word with non-zero fertility i.e. aligned to one or more
    target words.
Tablet:
    The set of target word(s) aligned to a cept.
Head of cept:
    The first word of the tablet of that cept.
Center of cept:
    The average position of the words in that cept's tablet. If the
    value is not an integer, the ceiling is taken.
    For example, for a tablet with words in positions 2, 5, 6 in the
    target sentence, the center of the corresponding cept is
    ceil((2 + 5 + 6) / 3) = 5
Displacement:
    For a head word, defined as (position of head word - position of
    previous cept's center). Can be positive or negative.
    For a non-head word, defined as (position of non-head word -
    position of previous word in the same tablet). Always positive,
    because successive words in a tablet are assumed to appear to the
    right of the previous word.

In contrast to Model 3 which reorders words in a tablet independently of
other words, Model 4 distinguishes between three cases.
(1) Words generated by NULL are distributed uniformly.
(2) For a head word t, its position is modeled by the probability
    d_head(displacement | word_class_s(s),word_class_t(t)),
    where s is the previous cept, and word_class_s and word_class_t maps
    s and t to a source and target language word class respectively.
(3) For a non-head word t, its position is modeled by the probability
    d_non_head(displacement | word_class_t(t))

The EM algorithm used in Model 4 is:
E step - In the training data, collect counts, weighted by prior
         probabilities.
         (a) count how many times a source language word is translated
             into a target language word
         (b) for a particular word class, count how many times a head
             word is located at a particular displacement from the
             previous cept's center
         (c) for a particular word class, count how many times a
             non-head word is located at a particular displacement from
             the previous target word
         (d) count how many times a source word is aligned to phi number
             of target words
         (e) count how many times NULL is aligned to a target word

M step - Estimate new probabilities based on the counts from the E step

Like Model 3, there are too many possible alignments to consider. Thus,
a hill climbing approach is used to sample good candidates.


Notations:
i: Position in the source sentence
    Valid values are 0 (for NULL), 1, 2, ..., length of source sentence
j: Position in the target sentence
    Valid values are 1, 2, ..., length of target sentence
l: Number of words in the source sentence, excluding NULL
m: Number of words in the target sentence
s: A word in the source language
t: A word in the target language
phi: Fertility, the number of target words produced by a source word
p1: Probability that a target word produced by a source word is
    accompanied by another target word that is aligned to NULL
p0: 1 - p1
dj: Displacement, Î”j
