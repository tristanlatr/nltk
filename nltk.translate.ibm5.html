        <div><p class="pre">Translation model that keeps track of vacant positions in the target
sentence to decide where to place translated words.

Translation can be viewed as a process where each word in the source
sentence is stepped through sequentially, generating translated words
for each source word. The target sentence can be viewed as being made
up of ``m`` empty slots initially, which gradually fill up as generated
words are placed in them.

Models 3 and 4 use distortion probabilities to decide how to place
translated words. For simplicity, these models ignore the history of
which slots have already been occupied with translated words.
Consider the placement of the last translated word: there is only one
empty slot left in the target sentence, so the distortion probability
should be 1.0 for that position and 0.0 everywhere else. However, the
distortion probabilities for Models 3 and 4 are set up such that all
positions are under consideration.

IBM Model 5 fixes this deficiency by accounting for occupied slots
during translation. It introduces the vacancy function v(j), the number
of vacancies up to, and including, position j in the target sentence.

Terminology:
Maximum vacancy:
    The number of valid slots that a word can be placed in.
    This is not necessarily the same as the number of vacant slots.
    For example, if a tablet contains more than one word, the head word
    cannot be placed at the last vacant slot because there will be no
    space for the other words in the tablet. The number of valid slots
    has to take into account the length of the tablet.
    Non-head words cannot be placed before the head word, so vacancies
    to the left of the head word are ignored.
Vacancy difference:
    For a head word: (v(j) - v(center of previous cept))
    Can be positive or negative.
    For a non-head word: (v(j) - v(position of previously placed word))
    Always positive, because successive words in a tablet are assumed to
    appear to the right of the previous word.

Positioning of target words fall under three cases:
(1) Words generated by NULL are distributed uniformly
(2) For a head word t, its position is modeled by the probability
    v_head(dv | max_v,word_class_t(t))
(3) For a non-head word t, its position is modeled by the probability
    v_non_head(dv | max_v,word_class_t(t))
dv and max_v are defined differently for head and non-head words.

The EM algorithm used in Model 5 is:
E step - In the training data, collect counts, weighted by prior
         probabilities.
         (a) count how many times a source language word is translated
             into a target language word
         (b) for a particular word class and maximum vacancy, count how
             many times a head word and the previous cept's center have
             a particular difference in number of vacancies
         (b) for a particular word class and maximum vacancy, count how
             many times a non-head word and the previous target word
             have a particular difference in number of vacancies
         (d) count how many times a source word is aligned to phi number
             of target words
         (e) count how many times NULL is aligned to a target word

M step - Estimate new probabilities based on the counts from the E step

Like Model 4, there are too many possible alignments to consider. Thus,
a hill climbing approach is used to sample good candidates. In addition,
pruning is used to weed out unlikely alignments based on Model 4 scores.


Notations:
i: Position in the source sentence
    Valid values are 0 (for NULL), 1, 2, ..., length of source sentence
j: Position in the target sentence
    Valid values are 1, 2, ..., length of target sentence
l: Number of words in the source sentence, excluding NULL
m: Number of words in the target sentence
s: A word in the source language
t: A word in the target language
phi: Fertility, the number of target words produced by a source word
p1: Probability that a target word produced by a source word is
    accompanied by another target word that is aligned to NULL
p0: 1 - p1
max_v: Maximum vacancy
dv: Vacancy difference, Î”v

The definition of v_head here differs from GIZA++, section 4.7 of
[Brown et al., 1993], and [Koehn, 2010]. In the latter cases, v_head is
v_head(v(j) | v(center of previous cept),max_v,word_class(t)).

Here, we follow appendix B of [Brown et al., 1993] and combine v(j) with
v(center of previous cept) to obtain dv:
v_head(v(j) - v(center of previous cept) | max_v,word_class(t)).
